The application uses modern React practices and is built with technologies like Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Leaflet.

## Features
- **Date Picker:** Allows users to choose a date for booking appointments while disabling unavailable dates.
- **Interactive Map:** Uses Leaflet to display clinic locations on an interactive map.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
